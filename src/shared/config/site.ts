  content: `Racquetball is a racquet sport played with a hollow rubber ball on an indoor or outdoor court. It was invented in 1950 by Joseph Sobek in Greenwich, Connecticut. The sport combines elements of handball, squash, and tennis.

Racquetball was one of the charter members of the World Games first held in 1981. It has been included in five IOC-Recognized Continental Games, including the Pan American Games, since 1995. The International Racquetball Federation (IRF) was formed in 1979 and was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1985 — one of the youngest sports ever to receive this recognition.

In India, the Indian Racquetball Association (IRA) was formed in 2023 and is affiliated to the International Racquetball Federation. The Rajasthan Racquetball Association (RRA) was formed in 2025 and received affiliation from the IRA in the same year.`,
